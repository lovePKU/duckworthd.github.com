My name is **Daniel Duckworth**, and I am a student at U. Mass. Amherst researching Artificial Intelligence.  My primary theoretical tools are Bayesian Inference and Probabilistic Models, and my favorite programming tools are Python (IPython + Numpy + Scipy + Matplotlib) and Scala.  In my free time, I try to practice my Japanese and go to concerts by the likes of [Rx Bandits](http://rxbandits.com/), [Doomtree](http://www.doomtree.net/), [Astronautalis](http://astronautalis.com/) and more.  I couldn't design a pretty webpage if my life depended on it.
